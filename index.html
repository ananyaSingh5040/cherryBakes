        <p class="journey">
          Well, well… Hello there! I'm Cherry, and I truly appreciate that
          you want to know more about me. It warms my heart!  So, how did my
          baking journey begin? It all started with one simple yet magical
          chocolate cake recipe—made entirely with Oreos!  I was beyond
          excited to try it, and little did I know, that single experiment would
          spark a deep love for baking. Now, let me be clear—I’m not a certified
          baker, nor do I have a formal degree in pastry arts. I’m simply a
          passionate home baker who finds pure joy in mixing, whisking, and
          creating sweet delights. Baking, for me, is more than just a skill;
          it’s a special hobby that brings me happiness and comfort.  From
          my first Oreo cake to trying out different flavors and techniques,
          every baking experience has been a learning journey. Sometimes, things
          go perfectly, and sometimes… well, let’s just say the oven and I have
          had our fair share of disagreements.  But that’s the beauty of
          baking—it’s all about experimenting, learning, and enjoying the
          process! Through this website, I want to share my love for baking with
          you. Whether you’re here for a simple, beginner-friendly recipe or
          just want to explore the world of sweet treats, I hope my journey
          inspires you to grab an apron and start baking!  So, welcome to my
          little baking world! Let’s create something delicious together.
